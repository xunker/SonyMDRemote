102us high

print_20.png
322us high

- We know that part of the 1/0 cycle is a period of 220us (print_05.png)
- 322us (print_20) subtract 102 (print_18 & 19) is 220 (the same as part of th 1/0 cycle)

Look at print_08

119us high time

- We know that part of the 1/0 cycle is a period of 18us (print_06.png)
- 119us - 18us is 101us, which is about the same as the 102us period in print_18 and 19

The first block of signals has 9 transitions.
Using Toerrin's work, assume the first transition is a zero.
Therefor zero is low 220us followed by 18us high.
... BUT LOOK AT print_19.png: Does that mean that the high part of a zero is don't care, only care that signal was low for 220 and then went high?
First block is almost always 9 zeros.

One is high 220us and low 18us?
It return to rest lever required after low pulse? See print_13.png and print_14.png?
If yes an 18us high after 18us low is to be ignored except as clock?

High pulse after first 9 of 119us. Mid-hex-byte separator?
There are other separators of ~102us. Is this really a 100us separator + 18us high pulse from a bit pair?

(Print_7.png)
Second block has 8 transitions.
Second block is 00000001

(Print_11.png)
578us high, is it really 340us + a bit pair (220us + 18us)?
Compare to print_20.png which looks like the end of a zero pair before another zero pair

------

Possible Delimiters:

100us high is a delimiter for connected bytes, e.g. bytes within the same field (like hex address or text string) (print18_png and print_19.png)?

200us high (print_16.png) that is (442us - 20us) - 220us? Is this the record separator?

300us high (print20.png) that is 322us - 20us. Another kind of record separator or delimiter?

IMPORTANT: Think serially and statefully:
You're lot looking to match the patterns! You're just looking for high periods!
They cascade in to one another!

Assuming we can ignore the 20us part of bits (print_19.png may show the length of the high period is not important for the bits):

..after initial 1100us low
* > 20us - bit separator
  - ..includes and extends in to..
* > 100us - connected byte separator
  - ..includes and extends in to..
* > 200us - field separator A
  - ..includes and extends in to..
* > 300us - field separator B
  - ..includes and extends in to..
* > 950us - message separator

------

THINK ABOUT THIS:

The "data" part of the signal is all denoted by length of LOW signal periods.
The "control" part of the signal is all denotes by the length of HIGH signal periods.

If above is true you then ONLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE LOW PERIOD LENGTHS TO EXTRACT THE BITS.
