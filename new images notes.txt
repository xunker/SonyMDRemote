102us high

print_20.png
322us high

- We know that part of the 1/0 cycle is a period of 220us (print_05.png)
- 322us (print_20) subtract 102 (print_18 & 19) is 220 (the same as part of th 1/0 cycle)

Look at print_08

119us high time

- We know that part of the 1/0 cycle is a period of 18us (print_06.png)
- 119us - 18us is 101us, which is about the same as the 102us period in print_18 and 19

-----

The first block of signals has 9 transitions.
Using Toerrin's work, assume the first transition is a zero.
Therefor zero is low 220us followed by 18us high.
First block is almost always 9 zeros.

High pulse after first 9 of 119us. Mid-hex-byte separator?
There are other separators of ~102us. Is this really a 100us separator + 18us high pulse from a bit pair?

(Print_7.png)
Second block has 8 transitions.
Second block is 00000001

(Print_11.png)
578us high, is it really 340us + a bit pair (220us + 18us)?
Compare to print_20.png which looks like the end of a zero pair before another zero pair
