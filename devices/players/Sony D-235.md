Sony Discman D-235 Portable CD Player
=====================================

From 1994. Compatible with RM-DM18L remote control.

# Connector

Connector pins are labeled in the service manual as, starting from the end closest to the headphone jack:
* GND
* RMK Y
* RMD T
* +B

Strangely, the service manual marks `RMD` as an input line, though it connects to pin 71 (`RM DATA`) of C801 SYSTEM CONTROLLER IC which is labeled as output. This could be a schematic typo because the pin can do double-duty as input and output in other devices with the same connector.

# Remote control display protocol
