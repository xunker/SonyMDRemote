Sony WM-FX855 Cassette Walkman
==============================

## Remote Connector Differences

This player (and possibly other Cassette Walkman players) is slightly different than the average connector:

1) Ground (same)
2) Remote In (this pin is *pulled-up* to about 2.7v, and remote control buttons pull it to ground through a resistor network unlike the average connector which is pulled to Vcc via a resistor network)
3) Data Out
4) ~1.4v (different voltage; connection to battery, usually it is to regulated power)
