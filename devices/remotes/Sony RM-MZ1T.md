Sony RM-MZ1T Remote
===================

> supplied with the MZ-G750, and MZ-G755. This remote provides quick access to volume controls, radio functions and navigation. The radio option is ONLY functional with G755 and G750. However, is provides no text and only display track time and track #. NO backlight ([Source](http://forums.sonyinsider.com/topic/11679-a-guide-to-sony-lcd-remotes/))

It looks physically identical to the [RM-CDF7L](Sony+RM-CDF7L.md) except for the "Walkman" logo. There may be protocol-level differences between the two models.
