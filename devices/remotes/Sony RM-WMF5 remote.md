Sony RM-WMF5 Remote
===================

Originally shipped with Walkman WM-FX494 and MW-FX496ST.

## Buttons

No display, transport and radio control buttons only. Volume wheel only.

3 buttons:
* Play / Switch Direction / Stop / Radio-On-Off
* FF / Next Preset
* RW / Previous preset

Hold switch is interesting in that, instead of disconnecting the remote control
pins like most other remotes do, it physically blocks the buttons from being
pushed.

## Button Resistances
