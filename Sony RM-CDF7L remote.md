RM-CDF7L Remote when used with MZ-NHF800
=========================================

## LCD
Although there is more space for other items, only three items come alive when
plugged in to a NHF800 while playing:

  * Current Track Number
  * Current Battery Level
  * Indication of volume change

## Buttons

All buttons function as expected, with the exception of "Radio On" button, which
is expected.

## Operation

Although the remote data line comes alive when you press "Stop" on the player
from an "off" state, that data stream does not seem to effect the display on the
remote in any way.

Can't wake up the player from "off" state with any remote buttons.

## TODO

* Probe pin resistances
